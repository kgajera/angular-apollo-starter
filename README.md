# Angular Apollo Starter

This starter project contains tools and configuration to start consuming a GraphQL API.

What is provided:
-  [Angular](https://angular.io/) project generated by the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)
-  [Apollo Angular](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular)
-  [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) to generate typings and Apollo services
-  [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for automated code formatting through pre-commit hooks

## Getting Started

1. Update `./src/environments/environment.ts` with the URL to your GraphQL server
1. Update `./codegen.yml` with the URL to your GraphQL server
1. Create `.graphql` file(s) containing your GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions in its respective folder in `./src/app/graphql/`
1. Run the code generator: `npm run graphql-codegen`

You are now ready to start developing your Angular project.
